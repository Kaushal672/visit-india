			"Situated amid the jagged crags of the Karakoram and Zanskar mountain ranges, Ladakh offers tourists the chance to immerse themselves in an awe-inspiring alpine desert. Driving around the region's winding roads comes with one incredible natural view after the next: plunging valleys, gushing rivers, snowcapped peaks, and more. Ladakh's enchanting capital, Leh, stands at 3,500 meters above sea level, so you'll want to spend at least a few days acclimating to the altitude before embarking on any strenuous activities.  Ladakh didn't open to tourists until 1974. Given its difficult-to-reach location and its long-time isolation, the Buddhist-majority region has retained a unique cultural identity and a somewhat  untouched  feel. You'll see Buddhist monasteries and temples all around Leh's Old Town, and countless colorful prayer flags fluttering in the breeze.  Don't miss the nine-story Leh Palace, which dates back to the 17th century, as well as the Shanti Stupa a monument to world peace. You can also see a superbly sustainable way of life in this traditional community, which receives very little imported goods and remains largely self-sufficient.",
